This document contains two sections:
  A. User manual for the Console-based application
  B. User manual for the user interface application
 ==================================================
 Section A:
  - Run Run.java in Eclipse.
  - Enter the number of nodes you wish to have in your network. Make sure it is a positive integer, 
    otherwise you will be prompted to re-enter a valid input. 
  - Enter the name you wish to give your nodes one at a time.
  - Enter the edge name which will connect your nodes. A sample input would be source_node<space>destination_node.
  - Once you're done with entering edges, enter done.
  - Enter the content of the message.
  - Enter the source node. Make sure the node you enter has already been created in the network.
  - Enter the destination node. Make sure the node you enter has already been created in the network.
  - The algorithm menu will be printed. Each algorithm will be preceded with a number. Enter the number 
    of the algorithm you want to be used in the network.
  - Enter the rate in which you want a new message to be generated in the network. You can enter no if you dont 
    want to enter a rate.
  - A sequence of messages will be printed to show you the path the message is taking.
  - Once the algorithm is done running and the message has reached its destination, the overall statistics will 
    be printed. This contains number of packets generated, and number of hops taken.
 ==================================================
 Section B:
  - Run UserInterfaceView.java from the UserInterfaceV2 package.
  - On the right hand side of the window select the algorithm you would like to use from the dropdown.
  - Add nodes to the network by entering them in the text box beside "Add Node".
  - To remove a node from the network, select the node name in the list and then click "Remove".
  - To link 2 nodes together select each one from their respective dropdown menu under "Link Nodes" and then click 
    "Link".
  - To unlink 2 nodes select each one from their respective dropdown menu under "Link Nodes" and then click "Unlink". 
    Note the process for unlinking nodes is not the same as deleting nodes, you cannot select the link in the list and
    click Unlink. You must select the 2 nodes from the dropdowns.
  - Enter the message contents.
  - Select a source and destination node for your message.
  - Optionally enter an injection rate for injecting new messages into the network during the simulation.
  - Click "Start Simulation" to simulate the message going through the network with your specified settings. 
  - While the simulation is running debug will be printed on the left hand side of the application.
  - Once the simulation is completed the network topology will appear in a new window showing the network layout and
    the path that the first message took.
