This document contains two sections:
  A. User manual for the Console-based application
  B. User manual for the user interface application
 ==================================================
 Section A:
  - Run Run.java in Eclipse.
  - Enter the number of nodes you wish to have in your network. Make sure it is a positive integer, otherwise you will be prompted to
    re-enter a valid input. 
  - Enter the name you wish to give your nodes one at a time.
  - Enter the edge name which will connect your nodes. A sample input would be source_node<space>destination_node.
  - Once you're done with entering edges, enter done.
  - Enter the content of the message.
  - Enter the source node. Make sure the node you enter has already been created in the network.
  - Enter the destination node. Make sure the node you enter has already been created in the network.
  - The algorithm menu will be printed. Each algorithm will be preceded with a number. Enter the number of the algorithm you want to be       used in the network.
  - Enter the rate in which you want a new message to be generated in the network. You can enter no if you dont want to enter a rate.
  - A sequence of messages will be printed to show you the path the message is taking.
  - Once the algorithm is done running and the message has reached its destination, the overall statistics will be printed. This contains     number of packets generated, and number of hops taken.
 ==================================================
 Section B:
  - Run UserInterface.java (Which can be found in UserInterface package) in Eclipse.
  - Enter the number of nodes you wish to have in your network in the text field and press enter. Make sure it is a positive integer.
  - Select the algorithm you want by clicking on one of the radio buttons.
  - Enter the rate in which you want a new message to be generated in the network. If the rate was left blank, then no new message will be     generated in the network.
  - Enter the name you wish to give your nodes in the generated text fields. Press enter after each enter so the name is recorded.
  - Enter the edge name which will connect your nodes. Each row will have two text fields. The left text field will represent the start       node. Once you enter the name press enter, and the right text field will be enabled for you to enter the end node.
  - Enter the Message content, the start node name, and the end node name in the textfields that will be generated. Make sure after every     input you press enter.
  - You can click on Show Topology button to see the graphical representation of the network
  - You can also click run to run the algorithm. The default algorithm is the Random Algorithm.
